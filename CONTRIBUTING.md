## Contributing
Contributing is simple :-)

To get started creating a new rule you will need to `npm i -g yo generator-eslint` and then run
`yo eslint`. It walks you through a few questions the only tricky one is that your rule will be
part of a plugin not core.

From there it's pretty easy, it stubs out your tests, documentation and rule file. Fill in the details
and you are ready for a pull request!
